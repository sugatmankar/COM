- Assuming 64 Bit COM Automation Dll Server, COM Proxy/Stub Dll And TypeLibrary Tlb Are Created And Copied To
  Windows\System32 And From Here The Proxy/Stub Dll Is Already Registered By RegSvr32 Command.

- Then From Windows\System32\Hosted Tlb File, A DotNet Compliant Dll Is Created Into The VB Source Code directory
  By Using Following Command In Visual Studio 2013's "64 Bit Native Command Prompt" :

  tlbimp c:\Windows\System32\AutomationServerTypeLib.tlb /out:.\AutomationServerTypeLibForDotNet.dll

- The Resulting DotNet Compliant Dll Is Used In VB Code As Namespace And As Well As On Compiler Command Line 
  To Create The Executable :

  vbc /t:winexe /r:Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll /r:AutomationServerTypeLibForDotNet.dll VBAutomation.vb

- Run VBAutomation.exe
